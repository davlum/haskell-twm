**Haskell Two-Way Mismatch**

Implementation of the two-way mismatch algorithm for fundamental frequency detection. Includes an implementation of the short-time Fourier transform in Haskell.

**Requirements**

This currently requires an installation of fftw, although there may be a switch to a [pure Haskell implementation](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/arb-fft) in the future.
For now the front end is just the cloned repository for the [web-dictaphone](https://github.com/mdn/web-dictaphone).
